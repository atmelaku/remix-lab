    <h2>OUR STORY: ARCHITECTURE FIRM TURNED DESIGN-BUILD GROUP</h2>
    <p>We’re on a mission to do architecture a little differently. Since 01-01-01, TONO Group has aspired to change the way we develop, design, and build. Believing architecture is a truly singular endeavor, we make exceptional places by employing a straightforward and efficient integrated project delivery process. Today’s design and construction industries are hyper-specialized and overly-compartmentalized; they breed contention and rivalry, while stifling innovation and creativity. At TONO Group, we’ve implemented a streamlined design-build process to fix that broken system.

Founded in the spirit of autonomy, TONO began as a boutique architectural practice. In 2011, we expanded into construction management and then into furniture and decor procurement in 2014. With the addition of real estate development and brokerage services in 2016, TONO Group has officially evolved to house a multi-disciplinary team with a focus on celebrating collaboration, perfecting the design-build process, and creating spaces that reflect distinct vision and purpose.

“Our intent is not only to make meaningful places that elevate the soul… but to make a better investment and consider the possibilities—to build with intention and sustainability in mind.”  – TONO Group Founder / CEO, D. Hunter Johnson, AIA.

Through strategic partnership and careful consideration, we’re creating meaningful places.
